# FastAPI---Task-Management-API
The system allows creating a task, updating the task status, fetching a specific task using task_id and listing all tasks with optional status filter. Each task will be auto generted with a task_id, title, description, status (pending, inprogress, completed &amp; failed) and timestamps for creation and updates. I've used FastAPI with clean Pydantic models for proper validation and appropriate error handling for invalid task ID's or status updates. All the data will be stored in the memory only and API works end to end through Swagger UI.
