# FastAPI---Task-Management-API
The system allows creating a task, updating the task status, fetching a specific task using task_id and listing all tasks with optional status filter. Each task will be auto generted with a task_id, title, description, status (pending, inprogress, completed &amp; failed) and timestamps for creation and updates.
